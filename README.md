ðŸ§  Thought Process & Design Inspiration

My aim was to build a clean, intuitive, and highly responsive MBA program finder.

Key design decisions included:

    User-Friendly Filters: Filters are prominently placed and easy to use with common UI elements like sliders and dropdowns.

    Efficient Loading: Implemented "Load More" with clear visual feedback (loading indicators, skeletons) to ensure a smooth experience without long waits.

    Clear Program Overviews: Each program card shows essential info at a glance for quick comparison.

    Mobile Responsiveness: Designed to work well on all device sizes.

    Professional Aesthetics: A clean design with blues/purples and readable fonts creates an inviting atmosphere.

    Helpful Feedback: Included messages for errors or when no programs match filters.

    Modular Code: Built with reusable components for better organization and maintenance.
